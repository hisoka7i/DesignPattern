Define a class which has only single instance and give global access of it.
Make sure single object can be used by different classes.
There are 2 kinds of initialization for it : lazy and eager.

It is mostly used in multithreaded application and database application: logging, caching, thread pools, configuration.

Deep copy of an object.
